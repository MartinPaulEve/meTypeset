         <p>A main concern for clinicians prior to applying a topical agent on an open wound is safety. Agents that are cytotoxic or cause delay in wound healing are used with reservation. The strongest argument against the use of antiseptics on wounds is that antiseptics have been found, primarily using <italic>in-vitro</italic> models, to be cytotoxic to cells essential to the wound healing process, such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and leukocytes.[29-31] However, this cytotoxicity appears to be concentration dependent, as several antiseptics in low concentrations are not cytotoxic, although they retain their antibacterial activity <italic>in vitro.</italic> [27] Since the <italic>in-vitro</italic> results are not always predictive of what may happen <italic>in vivo,</italic> numerous studies have been conducted on animal and human models. The results of these studies are conflicting and will be presented later in the article.</p> 
         <p>
            <bold>Cadexomer iodine.</bold> The efficacy of cadexomer iodine has been shown in both animal and human models (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="">Table 2</ext-link>). Mertz, et al.,[48] examined the effect of cadexomer iodine dressing on partial-thickness wounds in specific pathogen-free pigs contaminated with or without methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). Applied daily, cadexomer iodine was found to significantly reduce MRSA and total bacteria in the wounds in comparison to no treatment control and vehicle (cadexomer) at all time points studied (1, 2, and 3 days after inoculation). The reduction was most pronounced at day 3.</p> 
         <p>In an uncontrolled small study series (<italic>n</italic> = 19), Danielsen, et al.,[49] used cadexomer iodine in ulcers colonized with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and found negative cultures in 65 percent and 75 percent of patients after 1 and 12 weeks of treatment, respectively.</p>

         <p>Electroencephalographic measurements are commonly used in medical and research areas. This review article presents an introduction into EEG measurement. Its purpose is to help with orientation in EEG field and with building basic knowledge for performing EEG recordings. The article is divided into two parts. In the first part, background of the subject, a brief historical overview, and some EEG related research areas are given. The second part explains EEG recording.</p>
