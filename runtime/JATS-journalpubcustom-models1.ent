Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.
     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.1/

 27. ON-BEHALF-OF NEW CONTENT
     Added <xref>, <fn>, and <target> (the simple links) to 
     <on-behalf-of>.

 26. ADDED <string-date> to <mixed-citation> and <element-citation>
     through citation-elements.

 25. NEW ELEMENT <era>
     Added to the model of <date>, optional following year,
     through date-model.

 24. XML Base
     Added the attribute @xml:base to the Global (common)
     attributes used on all elements.

 23. INSTITUTION-WRAP ADDED
     Added the element <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - <conf-sponsor>
      - <publisher-name>
      - <std-organization>

 22.  GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     All attribute lists in this module changed.

 21. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
     - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
       (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
        - ack (through %ack-model;)
        - fig (through %fig-model;)
        - fig-group (through %fig-group-model;)

     - Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
       and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
       classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
       ways to be invoked.
        - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)

 20. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT MODEL
     - Added optional, repeatable <kwd-group> to the beginning of 
       <ack> (through %ack-model;).
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
 19. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 18. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
     at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs and ORCIDs.
      
 17. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
     to reduce what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.
   
 16. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
     - Added <issn-l> as an optional element to <journal-meta>
     - Added contributors and affiliations to journal metadata through
       contrib-group.class (which resolves to <contrib-group>) and 
       aff-alternatives.class (which resolves to <aff> or
       <aff-alternatives>), using the journal-meta-model.
   
 15. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
      
 14. PARAGRPH PARAMETER ENTITY SYNTAX CHANGE (no models changed)
     Fixed content models that were stated as "p*" and "sec*"
     to use the %just-para.class;, %sec.class, and %ref-list.class; 
     classes. Element models that were changed include:
      - abstract
      - ack
      - trans-abstract
   
 13. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 12. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
 11. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

 10. POSITION ATTRIBUTE - Added the value "background"

  9. PREFORMAT - Added <alt-text> and <long-desc> to <preformat> by
     adding %access.class; to %preformat-elements;

  8. INITIALS - Removed the attribute over-ride for <surname> and
     <given-names> to allow the use of @initials.

  7. JOURNAL METADATA- Added <notes> to repeat within <journal-meta>
     (through %journal-meta-model; and added @xml:lang and
     @specific-use to the attributes of <notes> through %notes-atts;

  6. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  5. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
     to the following over-rides:
      - inline-graphic through inline-graphic-atts (both)
      - fn through fn-atts (added @specific-use, @xml:lang already
          there)
      - person-group through person-group-atts (both)

  3. LABEL - Added optional <label> to <fig-group> using
     %fig-group-model; as the first element in model, before caption

  2. SELF URI - Added <self-uri> to <journal-meta> (directly
     following <notes>) so that an XML document can point to the
     journal home page.

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"              -->
