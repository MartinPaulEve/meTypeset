<!--
     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d1             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d1 (2013-12-15)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. The next
     official version of NISO JATS will be either 1.1 or 2.0.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.
     
 11. Replaced an incorrect formal public identifier for the 
     Archiving DTD with XTHML and MathML3. Changed"-//NLM//DTD JATS 
     (Z39.96) Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD v1.1d1 20130915//EN" 
     to the fpi: "-//NLM//DTD JATS 
     (Z39.96) Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD with MathML3 v1.1d1 
     20130915//EN"

 10. Removed all mentions of BITS files

  9. Removed duplicate declaration of JATS OASIS Table Setup Module

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d1 (prelim draft) (DAL/BTU) v1.1d1 (2013-11-15)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. The next
     official version of NISO JATS will be either 1.1 or 2.0.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

  7. Major DTD-fork to Add MathML 3.0 as an alternative to 
     MathML 2.0. They must never be used together, always
     one must be chosen. This added many more DTDs, as all
     options needed to be able to choose which Math to use.

  6. Modified comments to make it more obvious which modules are
     used together and which may be commented out or
     deleted. No catalog entries ever need to be commented
     out or deleted.

  5. Changed the filename to include "no-base" in the name.

  4. JATS became version "1.1d1" and "v1.1d1 20130915//EN"

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-09-20)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/
   
  3. Replaced OASIS modules to enhance control of OASIS 
     namespace and namespace prefix (v1.0 20120330//EN").

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become "NISO JATS
     Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.

  2. Updated the public identifiers to "v1.0 20120330//EN",
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  1. Updated public identifiers to "v3.0 20080202//EN"
     fresh start.                                                   -->

<!--                    SCOPE (JATS DTD Suite Version 1.1d1)        -->
<!-- ============================================================== -->

<!-- This catalog is made up of several groups, each with its own
     xml:base attribute, for:

       - NISO JATS Journal Publishing DTD (Blue)
       - The additional modules for the NISO JATS Journal Publishing 
           DTD (Blue) with OASIS and XHTML tables
       - NISO JATS Archiving and Interchange DTD (Green)
       - The additional modules for the NISO JATS Archiving and 
           Interchange DTD (Green) with OASIS and XHTML tables
       - NISO JATS Journal Authoring DTD (Pumpkin)
       - JATS DTD Suite common (shared) modules
       - JATS DTD Suite common (shared) modules from external 
            sources (table models, MathML, general entity 
            sets, etc.)                                         

     To work with relative files (such as in the Oxygen XML Editor), 
     use this catalog named "no-base", which has no @xml:base 
     attributes.  To set up a system-level catalog specific to a
     file system, set an @xml:base attribute on each <group> element 
     to the appropriate URI, such as a filename or system path.     -->

<!--  GROUPS AND ENTRIES

     Entries are grouped into logical clusters, organized by the
     particular DTD variant.

     Each catalog entry associates a PUBLIC identifier with a SYSTEM
     identifier.

     The @uri SYSTEM identifier is relative (resolved by the
     application, such as the Oxygen XML editor), and contains the
     filename of the DTD:

     The XML looks like this:

     <group>

<!-- ============================================================== -->

<!-- The OASIS catalog and the NCBI Suite of Modules provide a wide
     range of flexibility for setting up. Here are two easy ways to
     do it:


     1. WITHOUT an OASIS catalog (DTD components on a local system):

        - unzip the DTD packages you want to use into a single
          directory:

            - the journal-publishing package
            - the archive article package
            - the journal-authoring package
            - the book package

        - create your own DTD customization, if you need to,
          anywhere, using local (relative or absolute) SYSTEM
          identifiers to reference DTD modules.

        - create a document instance anywhere, and point its
          SYSTEM identifier to your customized DTD or to the
          package DTD you have chosen to use, using a local
          (relative or absolute) SYSTEM identifier.

        The SYSTEM identifiers used in the DTD modules are relative
        to the directory in which you have placed the DTD package
        and your customized DTD, and so your editor/processor will
        find them when reading the DTD.

     2. Using this OASIS catalog (DTD components on a local system):

        - unzip the DTD packages you want to use into a single
          directory, or into separate directories.
          
             - If you are using tools that work well with relative
               path locations (e.g., The Oxygen XML Editor), you can
               use this JATS catalog, named "no-base", that does
               not use the @xml:base attributes.
               
             - If you need to establish an @XML:base attribute,
               start from the other catalog, named "with-base"/

        - create your own DTD customization, if you need to,
          anywhere, using PUBLIC identifiers to reference the
          DTD modules.

        - tell your editor/processor about this OASIS catalog
          (Note: many apps must be closed and relaunched when
          a catalog file is first specified AND when it is changed)

        - create a document instance anywhere, and point its
          SYSTEM or PUBLIC identifier to the DTD you want to use,
          giving a relative SYSTEM path.

        Your editor/processor will map the PUBLIC identifiers
        in the DTD to the SYSTEM identifiers specified in
        this catalog.                                               -->
