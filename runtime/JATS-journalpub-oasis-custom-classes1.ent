<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.
     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.1/

  9. NEW CODE ELEMENT- Added <code> to
      - alternatives-display.class

 10. RUBY - Added <ruby> to emphasis.class. Added new 
     face-markup.class to handle all emphasis except <ruby>.
     <ruby> will not in this round be recursive.

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs, XSDs, 
     RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/

  7. CITATION ALTERNATIVES - Added a new element 
     <citation-alternatives> to the citation.class. The element
     will hold, for example, a single citation in multiple
     languages or a single citation tagged as a <mixed-citation>
     complete with punctuation and spacing and also as an
     <element-citation> with all punctuation and spacing removed.
   
   
  6. COLLABORATION ALTERNATIVES - Added <collab-alternatives> to
     the name.class, to allow a <collab-alternatives> elements to
     be anywhere <collab> already was.
   
     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.

  5. Created May 2010 as part of adding Publishing OASIS model
     that uses the OASIS CALS Exchange Table Model rather than the
     XHTML model. Updated the public identifier to 
     "v0.4 20110131", modified the formal public identifier to 
     include "JATS (Z39.96)", and the filename as delivered to 
     include "JATS" and the new version number "0".

  4. TABLE ELEMENTS- Added the OASIS CALS Table model to the
     table classes.

  3. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to contrib-info.class to hold multiple <aff>s that are
     representations of a single affiliation, for example, the name
     of an institution in two languages or two scripts.

  2. NAME ALTERNATIVES - Added <name-alternatives> to
     %name.class;, to therefore be used wherever name is allowed.

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"              -->
